# gradle-mesh

Gradle Plugin for [Genitcs Mesh](https://getmesh.io/) Headless CMS.

**Work in Progress**

This is a proof of concept for interacting with a Gentics Mesh server. The initial MVP prototype will explore concepts to:

* Define and merge schemas/microshemas definitions
* Publish and release content to the server
* Read content from the server and wire up results to task inputs/outputs
